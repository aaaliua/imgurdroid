# Imgurdroid
Basic Imgur client for Android

## Dependencies
Imgurdroid uses Imgur's [API](https://api.imgur.com/) to fetch information.

You'll need to sign up as a developer and add the client ID and secret to your local
`~/.gradle/gradle.properties` as the following:

```
IMGURDROID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
IMGURDROID_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```
